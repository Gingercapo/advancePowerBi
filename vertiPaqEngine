The VertiPaq engine is an in-memory, columnar database that stores and hosts the internal architecture of Power BI models. 


The VertiPaq engine is part of Excel's Power Pivot and SQL Server Analysis Services models as well. 

The VertiPaq engine stores and processes the data in the Power BI model by compressing the size of the model and the calculations behind the scenes.
